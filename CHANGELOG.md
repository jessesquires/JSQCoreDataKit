# CHANGELOG

The changelog for `JSQCoreDataKit`. Also see the [releases](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQCoreDataKit/releases) on GitHub.

--------------------------------------

2.2.0
-----

This release closes the [2.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQCoreDataKit/issues?q=milestone%3A2.2.0).

### New

Added a `resetStack()` top-level function. See the [updated docs](http://www.jessesquires.com/JSQCoreDataKit/Functions.html#/s:F14JSQCoreDataKit10resetStackFTCS_13CoreDataStack5queuePSo17OS_dispatch_queue_10completionFT6resultOS_19CoreDataStackResult_T__T_) for details. Thanks @marius-serban! :tada: 

### Changes

:warning: `CoreDataStackFactory.CompletionHandler` was moved from the factory's scope to the module's scope and renamed to `StackResultClosure`. This is *technically* a breaking change, but it is *highly* unlikely that anyone was referring to this closure directly. If so, simply rename to the correct type.

2.1.0
-----

`JSQCoreDataKit` now "officially" supports all Apple platforms: iOS, OSX, tvOS, watchOS. :tada:

### Breaking changes

- Swift 2.0

- You must now initialize `CoreDataStack` via a `CoreDataStackFactory`. This will init the stack on a background queue and return to your completion handler on the main queue when finished. This is necessary since adding a persistent store can take an unknown amount of time.

- Rethinking and rewriting of [`CoreDataStack`](http://www.jessesquires.com/JSQCoreDataKit/Classes/CoreDataStack.html). It now has a `mainContext` and a `backgroundContext`. :sunglasses: 

- [Saving](http://www.jessesquires.com/JSQCoreDataKit/Functions.html#/s:F14JSQCoreDataKit11saveContextFTCSo22NSManagedObjectContext4waitSb10completionGSqFOS_18CoreDataSaveResultT___T_) a context now returns a [`CoreDataSaveResult`](http://www.jessesquires.com/JSQCoreDataKit/Enums/CoreDataSaveResult.html) to the completion handler, instead of `NSError?`

### New

- New [`CoreDataStackFactory`](http://www.jessesquires.com/JSQCoreDataKit/Structs/CoreDataStackFactory.html) for async stack initialization, as mentioned above. It also support synchronous init if you need it, but this is only recommended for testing. Returns a [`CoreDataStackResult`](http://www.jessesquires.com/JSQCoreDataKit/Enums/CoreDataStackResult.html).

- All types now conform to `CustomStringConvertible` and `Equatable`. :facepunch:
