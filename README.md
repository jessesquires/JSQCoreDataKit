# JSQCoreDataKit [![CI](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQCoreDataKit/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQCoreDataKit/actions)

*A swifter Core Data stack*

## About

This library aims to do the following:

* Encode Core Data best practices, so you don't have to think "is this correct?" or "is this the right way to do this?"
* Provide better interoperability with Swift
* Harness Swift features and enforce Swift paradigms
* Bring functional paradigms to Core Data
* Make Core Data more *Swifty*
* Simplify the processes of standing up the Core Data stack
* Aid in testing your Core Data models
* Reduce the boilerplate involved with Core Data
